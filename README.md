So preety much in this DataFrame I have Data of the City,Date,Fare, Ride ID, Driver Count, and Type of city weather Urban, Suburban, or Rural. We merged two data frames into one , and narrowed it down to get specific data using the current data available to me. At the end the information that I wanted was the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Avarage Fare per Ride, and Avarage Fare per driver I learned exactly how to retrieve that information and created a Summary Data Frame and then formatted that out put to delete the type index and also adding a currency sign infront of total fares, avg. fare per ride , and avg. fare per driver. after I edited a previouse data frame and renamed the columns to be more presentable using the rename() function, I set an Index narrowing down and cleaning up the information creating new data frames along the way. I also converted an index to a date time. All this information was for the separated individually for three city types rural, suburban, and urban. The graph shows that not a lot of business is done in the rural areas it might be because of the population size who knows. The busiest is in the Urban neighborhoods. Pretty much in the rural areas business started slow and then took a small dip toward the months progressed while the big business urban peaked in march and then kept on going and it looks like there is a huge possibility for growth.
